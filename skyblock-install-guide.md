# Installing Project Ozone 3
This document will guide you through all of the installation steps required to install the modpack and join our modded skyblock server! Feel free to skip some of these steps if you already have a 64-bit Java install.

## Install Java 64-bit
In order to play modpacks, which require significantly more system memory than vanilla, you'll need to ensure that you have 64-bit Java installed, which will let you take advantage of more memory.

You can download Java from [this website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot). You must choose `OpenJDK 8 (LTS)` and the `HotSpot` JVM variant. From there, just download and install and you'll be good to go.

## Installing the modpack
There are two ways to go about this step, but this guide will only show one of the ways. You can either install the MulitMC launcher or the Curseforge launcher to download the modpack, but MultiMC is recommended.

Download MultiMC from the [official website](https://multimc.org/#Download) and then extract the files to a folder. 
- On Windows, run `MultiMC.exe` to start the launcher. 
- On macOS, simply draw `MultiMC.app` into your Applications folder and launch it. You might need to verify the app in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Allow apps downloaded from: ...`.

## Launching MultiMC
Once you launch MultiMC, it'll prompt you to select the Java version you wish to use. Make sure to select the variant of Java 1.8 that you have installed.

You'll also be asked about the amount of memory you wish to use. Make sure maximum memory it set to *at least* `6000 MB`, but giving it a bit more may not be a bad idea.

Now, let's install the modpack we need. Click `Add Instance` in the top-left of the MultiMC window and click the `Twitch` tab in the window that shows up. Now search `Project Ozone`, select the first one, and install it. It may take a little bit to download the pack files, so be patient.

## Launching the game
Simply select `Launch` in the right panel of MultiMC and go get yourself a cup of tea. The time it takes to launch the game depends heavily on your system, but it will take 5 minutes at the very minimum.

## Joining the server
Once your game has loaded and you're at the title screen of the game, simply select `Multiplayer` and `Add server`. Enter `exacu.be` as the server address and add it to your server list. Then join!

## Starting out on the server
After you've explored the spawn to look at the various guides we've laid out, you'll want to make sure you're in a team. Open your inventory and in the very top-left of your screen, click the teams button. It looks like this:

You can also invite your friends to your team if you want to add them to your island!

Once you have a team, simply run the `/is` command and a brand new island will be generated for you. Your team members can also use that command to teleport to your island.

## Quests
This modpack is heavily based around a quests system, so you'll want to open your quests book (comes in your inventory by default) to get started! Do not lose this book, it'll be your guide through the pack. In the event that you do lose it, you can bind a key for opening it in your controls.

## RAK
RAK, or Random Act of Kindness, is a currency that's used in this pack. By completing quests, you'll be able to save up RAK for buying rewards and loot boxes in the first page of the quests book.

You can also vote for the server using `/vote` to receive 10 RAK for free.

## Questions?
If you have questions, feel free to discuss in the modded section of our Discord or ask a staff member in chat. We hope you enjoy the pack and the server!
